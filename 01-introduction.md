### Creators

Created by team at Google:

- Robert Griesemar
- Rob Pike
- Ken Thompson

### Why a New Language

Languages primarily used at the time:

- Python - Easy to use but slow
- Java - Increasingly complex type system
- C/C++ - Quick, but complex type system and slow compile times

Go is:

- Strong and statically typed
- Excellent community
- Key features
  - Simplicity
  - Fast compile times
  - Garbage collected
  - Built-in concurrency
  - Compile to standalone binaries

### Basics

- Every Go program has to declare a `package`
- `main` is a special package.  It is the entry point to the application.
- `import` keyword used to import other packages.
- `main` function is the entry point.
